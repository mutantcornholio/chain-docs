# PAPI CHAIN DOCS

This is generated documentation for some well-known chains. We aim to support all relay chains and its system chains.

Note that this information might update a bit late after a runtime upgrade, since the docs are staticly generated once a day.

See [papi.how](https://papi.how) for general Polkadot-API documentation.

Happy hacking!
